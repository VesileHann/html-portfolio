<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Vesile , a budding computer engineering enthusiast excited to embark on my programming journey. As a beginner, I'm eager to explore the world of coding, starting with a focus on C++.
  <br/>While my coding experience is limited, I'm dedicated to building a strong foundation in C++. I find joy in deciphering the syntax, debugging my code, and witnessing the magic as lines of text transform into functional programs.<br />
   Currently a student at Istanbul Health and Technical University, I'm soaking up knowledge like a sponge. I'm actively exploring online tutorials, interactive coding platforms, and beginner-friendly resources to bolster my understanding.
 <br/> I'm excited to connect with fellow learners, seasoned programmers, and tech enthusiasts who are willing to share their wisdom and insights. I believe in the power of collaboration and learning from those who've walked this path before me.</p>
